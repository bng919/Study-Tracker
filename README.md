# Study Tracker
## Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected individuals across the world in a multitude of different ways. For myself, the way I receive my education is one aspect of my life which as been significantly changed as a result of the pandemic. I currently have very few classes with synchronous delivery. Most of my classes are now self directed, asynchronous learning. There are both benefits and draw backs to this. The increased flexibility of asynchronous learning is useful as I can prioritize different classes when I feel appropriate, however the major draw back for me as a result of this flexibility is time management. It requires much more organization and attention to stay on track without synchronous lectures or tutorials. I often find myself spending more time then I should on certain classes, while also spending less time then I should on others.

The goal of this program is to be a simple, easy to use application to track how much time the user spends working on each of their classes, projects, or extra-curricular activities, and provided the user with informative statistics and reminders about how they are spending their time.
As the project progresses, I hope to implement more Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques into the application to provide more insightful feedback on time usage.
